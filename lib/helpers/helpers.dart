final lyrics = [
  "I walk a lonely road",
  "The only one that I have ever known",
  "Don't know where it goes",
  "But it's only me, and I walk alone",
  "I walk this empty street",
  "On the boulevard of broken dreams",
  "Where the city sleeps",
  "And I'm the only one, and I walk alone",
  "I walk alone, I walk alone",
  "I walk alone and I walk a",
  "My shadow's the only one that walks beside me",
  "My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating",
  "Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me",
  "Till then I walk alone",
  "Ah ah ah ah ah",
  "Ah ah ah ah ah",
  "I'm walking down the line",
  "That divides me somewhere in my mind",
  "On the border line of the edge",
  "And where I walk alone",
  "Read between the lines",
  "What's fucked up and every thing's all right",
  "Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive",
  "And I walk alone",
  "I walk alone, I walk alone",
  "I walk aloneâ€¦",
